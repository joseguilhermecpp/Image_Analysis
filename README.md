# Automated Imaging Platform for In Situ Sensing and Analysis of Soil Solution Chemistry

**Name**: Jose Cesario Pinto<br/>
**Semester**: Spring 2020 <br/>
**Project area**: Agronomy

## Objective
Develop a python function to automate the digitization of analysis of two dimensional analyte concentration in optode images. Thus, quantify soil solution chemistry through the planar optical soil sensor system.
  
## Outcomes
I want the function to produce a .csv file that deploys the platform in a graph correlating the pixel intensity with the oxygen concentration percentage from the optode image.

## Rationale
Plant roots and associated belowground processes are foundational to agricultural productivity as well as to global terrestrial water, carbon and nutrient cycles. Developing automated methods for imaging and analyzing the belowground environment is crucial for gaining the mechanistic and predictive understanding of belowground dynamics needed to meet the demands of feeding a growing human population, maintain soil and water quality, and advance predictions of environmental interaction and change. A key challenge for belowground investigations is non-destructively collecting data at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to the studied processes. The merger of belowground imaging and two-dimensional soil sensing can address this challenge. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a python script to automate image processing of soil solution chemistry images in order to advance knowledge of belowground processes, and consequently benefit researchers and instructors to improve the knowledge on this area.
